# Api Cals

# Here is a description of what each directory represents:

defaults: This directory lets you set default variables for included or dependent roles. Any defaults set here can be overridden in playbooks or inventory files.
files: This directory contains static files and script files that might be copied to or executed on a remote server.

handlers: All handlers that were in your playbook previously can now be added into this directory.

meta: This directory is reserved for role metadata, typically used for dependency management.. For example, you can define a list of roles that must be applied before the current role is invoked.

templates: This directory is reserved for templates that will generate files on remote hosts. Templates typically use variables defined on files located in the vars directory, and on host information that is collected at runtime.

tasks: This directory contains one or more files with tasks that would normally be defined in the tasks section of a regular Ansible playbook. These tasks can directly reference files and templates contained in their respective directories within the role, without the need to provide a full path to the file.

vars: Variables for a role can be specified in files inside this directory and then referenced elsewhere in a role.
